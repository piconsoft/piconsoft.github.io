    <h1>Enterprise Cloud &amp; Infra Trends 2025</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      In 2025, cloud strategy is less about ‚Äúwhere workloads live‚Äù and more about <strong>how fast value ships</strong>,
      <strong>how well costs are governed</strong>, and <strong>how resilient your platforms are</strong>. Here are the trends I see
      shaping enterprise IT ‚Äî and how to turn them into delivery outcomes.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1) AI-First Delivery &amp; Ops</h2>
    <p>
      AI is becoming a core capability across delivery, test, security, and ops. Expect AI assistance in backlog grooming,
      code reviews, incident triage, change risk scoring, and post-mortems. The organizations that win treat AI as a
      <em>platform service</em>, not a side tool ‚Äî with clear guardrails, data access policies, and cost visibility.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">Move: Stand up an internal AI enablement track (prompt libraries, policy, cost controls) and integrate it with dev &amp; SRE workflows.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2) FinOps Maturity (from Visibility to Accountability)</h2>
    <p>
      Most enterprises achieved cost <em>visibility</em>. 2025 is about <em>accountability</em>: budgets at the product/team level,
      unit economics (cost per transaction/user), and automated rightsizing. Tie spend to outcomes, not just tags.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Allocate budgets to product lines with monthly variance reviews.</li>
      <li>Automate lifecycle policies for under-utilized storage/compute.</li>
      <li>Publish a simple ‚Äúgolden dashboard‚Äù for execs and product owners.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3) Platform Engineering as the New Operating Model</h2>
    <p>
      Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) unify golden paths: secure baselines, IaC modules, CI/CD templates, central
      secrets, observability, and policy-as-code. The goal isn‚Äôt more tools ‚Äî it‚Äôs <strong>frictionless, compliant delivery</strong>.
      Teams consume paved roads; the platform team measures lead time, failure rate, and rework.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">Measure what matters: DORA + security evidence lead time (time to attestation).</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4) Multi-Cloud Governance without the Complexity Hangover</h2>
    <p>
      Multi-cloud is common, but unmanaged sprawl hurts. Standardize on <strong>control planes</strong> for identity,
      networking, and policy. Use a single source of truth for org structure, RBAC, tagging, and guardrails so products
      can move across clouds without re-inventing controls.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Central identity (SSO, workload identity), consistent roles and group policies.</li>
      <li>Network blueprints with repeatable patterns (hub-spoke, shared services).</li>
      <li>Policy-as-code enforcing tags, encryption, and boundaries from day one.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5) Hybrid Resilience &amp; Sovereignty</h2>
    <p>
      Critical enterprises will continue to run hybrid. What changes in 2025: <strong>uniform resilience</strong>
      (consistent backup, DR patterns, and failover tests) and <strong>data sovereignty</strong> (jurisdictional controls,
      residency, and regionality baked into design).
    </p>
    <div class="callout">Run DR game-days quarterly; make evidence (RTO/RPO results) visible to risk &amp; audit.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6) Security-as-Code Everywhere</h2>
    <p>
      Security shifts left and right: controls are expressed in IaC modules and validated in CI, while runtime policies
      and evidence are continuous. This reduces drift and shortens audit cycles from months to days.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Approved IaC modules with embedded controls (encryption, logging, tags).</li>
      <li>Pre-merge policy checks, SBOMs, and secret scanning.</li>
      <li>Runtime guardrails (e.g., drift detection, egress control, anomaly response).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Leadership Perspective (cross-industry)</h2>
    <p>
      Across <strong>banking, energy, and manufacturing</strong>, the biggest unlock wasn‚Äôt a new tool ‚Äî it was aligning product,
      platform, and governance under a shared scorecard. When platform teams provide paved roads and transparent costs,
      product teams ship faster <em>and</em> safer. When risk and compliance see real-time evidence, audits become routine,
      not events.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Practical Moves for the Next 90 Days</h2>
    <ol class="list">
      <li><strong>Define your paved roads:</strong> Publish one golden path per archetype (web API, data pipeline, batch job).</li>
      <li><strong>Stand up unit economics:</strong> Cost per customer/txn visible to product owners; review monthly.</li>
      <li><strong>Make policy visible:</strong> Shift policy checks into CI and fail builds when non-compliant.</li>
      <li><strong>Resilience drill:</strong> Choose a critical service and run a DR game-day; publish results and fixes.</li>
      <li><strong>AI enablement:</strong> Provide approved assistants, prompts, and data access patterns for dev &amp; SRE.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Outlook &amp; Call-to-Action</h2>
    <p>
      2025 favors organizations that turn platforms into products, costs into insights, and policy into code.
      If your cloud strategy accelerates delivery <em>and</em> strengthens resilience, you‚Äôre on the right path.
    </p>
    <p><strong>üëâ Which of these trends will you operationalize first this quarter?</strong></p>
